/* COPY CONSTRUCTOR :
    A copy constructor is a member function that initializes an object using 
    another object of the same class.

/* When is  copy constructor called? 
  In C++, a Copy Constructor may be called in the following cases: 
   1. When an object of the class is returned by value. 
   2. When an object of the class is passed (to a function) by value as an argument. 
   3. When an object is constructed based on another object of the same class. 
   4. When the compiler generates a temporary object. */


/* 1. Can we make copy constructor private? 
   Yes, a copy constructor can be made private. When we make a copy constructor private 
   in a class, objects of that class become non-copyable. This is particularly useful 
   when our class has pointers or dynamically allocated resources. 
   In such situations, we can either write our own copy constructor like above String 
   example or make a private copy constructor so that users get compiler errors rather 
   than surprises at runtime. 



   2. Why argument to a copy constructor must be passed as a reference? 
    A copy constructor is called when an object is passed by value. Copy constructor 
    itself is a function. So if we pass an argument by value in a copy constructor, 
    a call to copy constructor would be made to call copy constructor which becomes a
    non-terminating chain of calls. Therefore compiler doesnâ€™t allow parameters to be
    passed by value.
